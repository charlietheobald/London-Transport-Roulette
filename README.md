# London-Transport-Roulette

Hi everyone, welcome to the official download page for the Python program featured in Transport Roulette videos on the It's All About The Journey YouTube channel!




* How can I download the code, and how can I run it on my phone?


* If you're an Android user:
  * Open this link on your mobile phone. Click on the file above called "london-transport-roulette.py". Then click the download icon in the toolbar to save it to your device. Save it in a sensible place so you can come back to it later.
  * To open and run this Python file, you'll need some kind of Python IDE app on your phone. If you're an Android user, I recommend Pydroid 3 (available on the Google Play Store).
  * Open your Python app of choice, and Open the .py file you've just downloaded. There will usually be a "Play" button to run the code - you'll need to do this every time you want to play a new round.
  * Your code should work everywhere, even when you're not connected to a WiFi network.


* If you're an iPhone / iOS user:
  * Unfortunately, running Python on an iPhone is significantly more difficult than on an Android phone. For iPhones, it's usually best to use Python in Safari.
  * Open this link on your mobile phone. Click on the file above called "london-transport-roulette.py". Select and Copy all the lines of code (the text with a number at the start of each line).
  * Visit the following link on Safari for an online version of Python: https://pythononline.net/
  * and Paste your code into the white text box. Clicking the green button will allow you to run the program - you'll need to do this every time you want to play a new round.
  * You'll need a WiFi or cellular connection to access this website, so it may be a bit challenging to use in tube tunnels or remote locations with no mobile signal.



* Can I modify this code?
  * Yes, of course! Feel free to modify this code how you'd like to use it, or maybe even modify it for your city! With a few adjustments, this program will work in any city around the world! If you're familiar with using Github then feel free to fork this repo.



* Why did I create this program?

  * Transport Roulette has historically been played with three or more dice to determine the next transport mode, direction and number of stops. There is an issue with this though, and to see this we'll need to talk a little bit about maths.

  * When you add or multiply the results on two or more dice together, the result is NOT in fact random. This means that when you roll two dice to determine a number of stops to travel, or the next bus to catch, there are certain numbers that are more likely to come up than others (massive simplification - this is a transport channel, not a maths forum). Ideally, for example, we want every bus route to have an equal chance of coming up, and simulating this using a computer program makes this much more likely to be random than using dice. Python also allows more complicated things to run in the background too that would be much more difficult if you were to use dice (see below!)



* What changes are coming in the future?

  * I want to keep this program as accessible as possible to users, but the possibilities of using Python are almost limitless. In the future, I would like to link this Transport Roulette code with TfL's API to get live station and destination information. This is the same feed of data used to get live bus countdowns to your phone, or tells you the quickest way to get between two tube stations. This would allow for things like automatic line / destination acquisition based on your current location (which would be extremely cool!) but I'm not sure on the licensing
